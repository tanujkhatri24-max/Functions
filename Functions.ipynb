        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high-level programming language that is very simple and easy\n",
        "  to understand. It uses English-like words, so even beginners can learn it quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "     It is popular because:\n",
        "      * It is easy to read and write.\n",
        "      * It has a huge collection of libraries for data, web, AI, and more.\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "    - In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and runs the code line by line.\n",
        "   Because of the interpreter, we don’t need to convert the whole program into machine language at once. This makes Python easy to test and debug.\n",
        "3. What are predefined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Predefined keywords in Python are special words that have a fixed meaning and purpose in the language.\n",
        "   They are already reserved by Python, so we cannot use them as names for variables, functions, or anything else.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Examples\n",
        "   `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `True`, `False`, `import`, 'class',\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "   This is because keywords already have a special meaning in the language. If we try to use them as variable names, Python will get confused and show an error.\n",
        "5. What is mutable in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, *mutable* means something that can be changed after it is\n",
        "     created.\n",
        "     If an object is mutable, we can modify its values without making a new object.\n",
        "    \n",
        "     Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "           numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "           umbers[0] = 10     \n",
        "           rint(numbers)      \n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable because their elements can be changed, added, or  \n",
        "     removed after the list is created.\n",
        "     For example, we can update a value in a list or insert a new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Tuples are immutable, which means once a tuple is created, we cannot    change its values. This makes tuples faster and safer to use when we don’t want the data to be modified.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between `==` and `is` operator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The `==` operator is used to check if two values are **equal**. It only\n",
        "      compares the data stored inside the objects.\n",
        "    - The `is` operator is used to check if two objects are actually the\n",
        "      same object in memory.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   -  Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditions and make\n",
        "      decisions in a program.\n",
        "   -  There are three main logical operators:\n",
        "    \n",
        "       -  **and** – returns True only if both conditions are True.\n",
        "       -   **or** – returns True if at least one condition is True.\n",
        "       -   **not** – reverses the result (True becomes False, and False becomes True).\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   -  Type casting in Python means changing the data type of a value into\n",
        "     another data type.\n",
        "     - For example, converting an integer into a string, or a float into an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Python has some built-in functions for type casting like:\n",
        "\n",
        "        * `int()` → converts to integer\n",
        "         * `float()` → converts to float\n",
        "        * `str()` → converts to string\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. **Implicit Type Casting (Type Conversion):**\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Done automatically by Python.\n",
        "        * Python converts smaller data types into bigger data types to avoid data loss.\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "    2. **Explicit Type Casting (Type Casting):**\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Done manually by the programmer using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.\n",
        "        \n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?  \n",
        "     -  The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to make decisions\n",
        "        in a program.\n",
        "      - They allow the program to run different code depending on whether a\n",
        "        condition is True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "      For example, using **if, elif, else**, we can check conditions and control the flow of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 10\n",
        "if x > 5:\n",
        "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work in Python?\n",
        "    -  The `elif` statement in Python is used when we want to check **more than one condition**.\n",
        "     -  It means **“else if”**. If the first `if` condition is False, then\n",
        "       Python checks the `elif` condition.\n",
        "       If that is also False, it moves to the next `elif` or the `else` part.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 20\n",
        "\n",
        "if x < 10:\n",
        "    print(\"x is less than 10\")\n",
        "elif x < 30:\n",
        "    print(\"x is less than 30\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"x is 30 or more\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "13. What is the difference between FOR and WHILE loop?\n",
        "     -   Both **for** and **while** loops are used to repeat a block of code,\n",
        "      but they work in different ways:\n",
        "\n",
        " * **For loop:**\n",
        "\n",
        "      * Used when we know how many times we want to run the loop.\n",
        "      * Works with sequences like lists, strings, or a range of numbers.\n",
        "      * Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "      for i in range(5):\n",
        "      print(i)   # prints 0 to 4\n",
        "      ```\n",
        "\n",
        "* **While loop:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Used when we do not know the exact number of repetitions.\n",
        "  * Runs as long as the condition is True.\n",
        "  * Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "      x = 0\n",
        "      while x < 5:\n",
        "      print(x)\n",
        "     x += 1\n",
        "      ```\n",
        "14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "      -  A while loop is more suitable when we **do not know in advance how many times the loop should run**.\n",
        "      - It keeps repeating until a certain condition becomes False.\n",
        "\n",
        "      **Example scenario:**\n",
        "     - Asking a user to enter a password until they type the correct one.\n",
        "      Here, we don’t know how many attempts the user will take, so a while loop is better.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "password = \"\"\n",
        "while password != \"1234\":\n",
        "password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n",
        "print(\"Access Granted!\")\n",
